Welcome to the Monument Selection Guide

A simple application that will allow someone to design a headstone step by step all in the comfort of their own home.

This project came about because we needed to update our monument selection guide at my current job. ( I work for a company that makes headstones. )

The plan as of March 5th, 2024 is that it will be a step by step form that will all be on a single page. Each Section will be a form input and only one section will displayed at a time. Each submission will be saved in the Session Storage so there won't be any saving progress or anything along those lines, although that is something to think about in the future if we end up wanting to upgrade the scripts.

The biggest part of this is what based on the information submitted throughout the guide/form, the code will generate a generic image showing people what the stone could look like. It will be generated on plenty of if statements based on the Session data that will be saved.

Here is the technologies that are planned to be used in this:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
React
Bootstrap
